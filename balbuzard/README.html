<h1 id="balbuzard">Balbuzard</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.decalage.info/python/balbuzard">Balbuzard</a> is a package of malware analysis tools in python to extract patterns of interest from suspicious files (IP addresses, domain names, known file headers, interesting strings, etc). It can also crack malware obfuscation such as XOR, ROL, etc by bruteforcing and checking for those patterns.</p>

<p>Balbuzard tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>balbuzard</strong> is a tool to extract patterns of interest from malicious files, such as IP addresses, URLs, embedded files and typical malware strings. It is easily extensible with new patterns, regular expressions and Yara rules.</li>
<li><strong>bbcrack</strong> uses a new algorithm based on patterns of interest to bruteforce typical malware obfuscation such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various combinations, in order to guess which algorithms/keys have been used.</li>
<li><strong>bbharvest</strong> extracts all patterns of interest found when applying typical malware obfuscation transforms such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various combinations, trying all possible keys. It is especially useful when several keys or several transforms are used in a single file.</li>
<li><strong>bbtrans</strong> can apply any of the transforms from bbcrack (XOR, ROL, ADD and various combinations) to a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>When to use these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to analyze a new malicious file, you can first try balbuzard to extract patterns of interest and detect embedded files in cleartext.</li>
<li>Then if you think the malicious file might use an obfuscation algorithm such as XOR to hide interesting data, try bbcrack to find the algorithm and the key(s).</li>
<li>Alternatively, if bbcrack is not successful, or if you think the file may use several algorithms and/or keys, try bbharvest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note: while balbuzard and bbharvest are straightforward and readily usable, bbcrack is still an experimental tool and it has not been tested on many samples yet. Please <a href="http://www.decalage.info/contact">contact me</a> if you test these tools on malware samples to tell me if it works or not.</p>

<p>Open a shell or a cmd.exe, go to the directory where you unzipped balbuzard. First, let's try balbuzard:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples/sample1.doc</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

<p>Obviously this is a MS Office document (magic at offset 0000), containing a MS Windows executable file located at offset 6C00. Balbuzard detects a number of interesting strings:</p>
<ul>
<li>an IP address: '12.34.56.78'</li>
<li>a URL: http://www.ccserver.com</li>
<li>an e-mail address: target@acme.com</li>
<li>an executable filename: payload.dll</li>
<li>a function to detect a debugger: 'IsDebuggerPresent'</li>
<li>a function to write a registry value: 'RegSetValue'</li>
<li>a registry key name used by malware to run at startup: 'CurrentVersion\Run'</li>
</ul>
<p>All this information may be very useful when analyzing this file further with other tools (sandbox, debugger, disassembler, etc).</p>
<p>Let's try balbuzard on a second sample:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples/sample2.doc</code></pre>
<p>This time, balbuzard only sees a MS Office document, but nothing else. However, when looking at the file with a hex viewer, there is an area at the end which looks suspicious. Let's use bbcrack to check if a known obfuscation algorithm has been used to hide data:</p>
<pre><code>bbcrack.py -l 1 samples/sample2.doc</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>STAGE 1: quickly counting simple patterns for all transforms

<p>bbcrack runs all known transforms (XOR, ROL, ADD and many combinations) with all their possible keys. Then a score is computed for each, based on the patterns of interest found in the transformed file. By default, the ten best scores are written to disk.</p>
<p>Here if we check the best score obtained with &quot;xor67_rol3&quot; in a hex viewer or with balbuzard, it turns out to be an executable file that was hidden within the document, obfuscated with a XOR+ROL algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples/sample2_xor67_rol3.doc

<p>Now, let's check the third sample:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples/sample3.exe

at 00000000: EXE MZ followed by PE - &#39;MZ\x90\x00\x03\x00\x00\...\x00\x00\x00PE\x00\x00&#39;
at 0000004E: EXE PE DOS message - &#39;This program cannot be run in DOS mode&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This is an executable file, but there is no interesting string in clear text. If we run bbcrack, there is no useful result either. However, we know this small file is suspicious, and there seem to be obfuscated strings in it. Let's try bbharvest to look for obfuscated patterns of interest:</p>
<pre><code>bbharvest.py samples/sample3.exe

*** WARNING: harvest mode may return a lot of false positives!
identity: at 00000000 EXE MZ followed by PE, string=&#39;MZ\x90\x00\x03\x00\x00\...\x00\x00\x00PE\x00\x00&#39;

rol3_addD6: at 000002E0 IPv4 address, string=&#39;74.125.136.94&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This time, bbharvest found three strings obfuscated with different transforms and keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>an e-mail address obfuscated with XOR 11</li>
<li>two IP addresses obfuscated with XOR 88 + ROL 5, and ROL 3 + ADD D6</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the end of this short demo. The next sections explain how to use the tools with more details and other examples.</p>

<h2 id="balbuzard-1">balbuzard:</h2>
<p>balbuzard is a malware analysis tool to extract patterns of interest from malicious files, such as IP addresses, URLs, typical EXE strings and common file headers.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: When I need to analyse a malicious/suspicious file, the first thing I do is to open it into a hex viewer, to see which type of file it is with my own eyes. Then I quickly browse the file, looking for specific items of interest such as text, URLs, IP addresses, other embedded files, etc. This is very useful to decide how to analyse the file further, but also to extract evidence or potential <a href="http://www.openioc.org/">indicators of compromise (IOCs)</a>.</p>
<p>But as soon as a file is larger than a few kilobytes, this can become very tedious, and you can overlook key details. This is why I wrote a simple script in 2007 called <a href="http://www.decalage.info/rescan">rescan</a> to search for a list of regular expressions matching specific patterns, published as open-source for the <a href="http://www.decalage.info/sstic08">SSTIC08 conference</a>. Since then I improved the tool significantly and renamed it to Balbuzard.</p>

<ul>
<li>search for string or regular expression patterns</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>
<p>Balbuzard looks for a number of patterns that correspond to items of interest when analyzing a malicious file. Each pattern can be a single string such as &quot;This program cannot be run in DOS mode&quot; which is present in most executable files on Windows, or a list of strings. It may also be a regular expression matching IP addresses, e-mail addresses or more complex patterns.</p>
<p>Each found pattern is reported with its position, its length and value. With the -v option, a short hex dump can be displayed with a few bytes around the pattern.</p>
<p>The list of patterns to look for can be easily extended by adding a python script in the plugins directory (see below).</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<pre><code>Usage: balbuzard.py [options] &lt;filename&gt; [filename2 ...]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CSV, --csv=CSV     export results to a CSV file
  -v                    verbose display, with hex view.
  -r                    find files recursively in subdirectories.
  -z ZIP_PASSWORD, --zip=ZIP_PASSWORD
                        if the file is a zip archive, open first file from it,
                        using the provided password (requires Python 2.6+)
  -f ZIP_FNAME, --zipfname=ZIP_FNAME
                        if the file is a zip archive, file(s) to be opened
                        within the zip. Wildcards * and ? are supported.
                        (default:*)</code></pre>
<h3 id="how-to-select-input-files">How to select input files</h3>
<p>You can specify one or several files to be analyzed:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py sample1.doc sample2.doc sample3.exe</code></pre>
<p>Using wildcards, it is possible to scan several files in a folder:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples/*.bin</code></pre>
<p>With the -r option, the search is recursive in all subfolders:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py malwarezoo/*.exe -r</code></pre>
<p>When scanning several files at once, it is recommended to use the CSV output (see below).</p>
<p>As many malware samples are stored in password-protected zip files, balbuzard is able to extract such files in memory to analyze them without writing to disk. This avoids being blocked by an antivirus. Use the option -z to specify the zip password:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py -z infected malwarezoo/sample123.zip</code></pre>
<p>By default, all files in the zip archive are extracted and analyzed. You may use the option -f to select files within the zip archive. Wildcards are supported, and the search is recursive:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py -z infected malwarezoo/sample123.zip -f sample1.exe</code></pre>
<p>For example, if you wanted to analyze all the <a href="http://contagiodump.blogspot.nl/2013/03/mandiant-apt1-samples-categorized-by.html">APT1 samples</a> available on the Contagio website, you could run this command:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py -z *** APT1_MALWARE_FAMILIES_samples.zip -f *sample*</code></pre>
<h3 id="csv-output">CSV output</h3>
<p>With the -c option, results can be written in a CSV file, suitable for further analysis:</p>
<pre><code>balbuzard.py samples\*.bin -c results.csv</code></pre>
<h3 id="verbose-output">Verbose output</h3>
<p>With the -v option, each matched string is displayed with a hexadecimal dump:</p>
<pre><code>C:\balbuzard&gt;balbuzard.py -v test.exe

<h3 id="how-to-extend-the-list-of-patterns">How to extend the list of patterns</h3>
<p>Additional patterns can be provided by creating plugin scripts written in Python: each script needs to be named bbz*.py, and placed in the plugins folder. Each plugin script should add a list of Pattern objects to the patterns list, for example:</p>
<pre><code>    patterns += [
        # example: a pattern with a simple case-INsensitive string
        Pattern(&quot;EXE PE DOS message&quot;, &quot;This program cannot be run in DOS mode&quot;, nocase=True),
        # example: a pattern with a list of strings
        Pattern(&quot;EXE: section name&quot;, [&quot;.text&quot;, &quot;.data&quot;, &quot;.rdata&quot;, &quot;.rsrc&quot;])
        # example: a pattern with a regular expression, case-insensitive
        Pattern_re(&quot;Executable filename&quot;, r&quot;\w+\.(EXE|COM|VBS|JS|VBE|JSE|BAT|CMD|DLL|SCR)&quot;, nocase=True),
        ]</code></pre>
<p>See bbz_sample_plugin.py in the plugins folder for more examples.</p>
<p>If <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/downloads/list">yara-python</a> is installed, you may also use Yara rules as patterns for Balbuzard. For this, simply copy Yara rules as .yara files in the plugins directory. See capabilities.yara as an example.</p>
<p>To disable a plugin (python or yara), you can simply rename the file with an extension such as &quot;.disabled&quot;.</p>
<p>If you develop useful plugin scripts and you would like me to reference them, or if you think about additional transforms that bbcrack should include, please <a href="http://www.decalage.info/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-differences-with-yara">What are the differences with Yara?</h3>
<p>Balbuzard may look similar to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yara-project">Yara</a>, which is also a tool to search specific patterns into malicious files. First, Balbuzard is simpler than Yara. Balbuzard's patterns are simple strings or regular expressions, whereas Yara supports more complex rules. Balbuzard is a simple and portable pure python script, whereas Yara contains C code that needs to be compiled or installed as a library. Second, Yara's original purpose is to &quot;identify and classify malware families&quot; aimed at detection, whereas Balbuzard is to extract specific patterns from files that are already known as malicious. So in the end I would say that both tools are complementary.</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible to implement Balbuzard's set of patterns using Yara rules, and I plan to use the Yara engine as an option in the near future. It is already possible to use Yara rules to extend Balbuzard patterns.</p>
<p>Back in 2007-2008 when I started developing this tool as rescan, Yara was not yet published. And since then, I kept it like this because I preferred to have a lightweight pure python script to develop other tools without requiring the installation of Yara.</p>
<h3 id="other-similar-tools">Other similar tools</h3>
<p>Besides Yara, the following tools may also be used to search specific patterns within files: <a href="http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#signsrch">signsrch</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/clamsrch/">clamsrch</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/binwalk/">binwalk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bbcrack">bbcrack:</h2>
<p>bbcrack (Balbucrack) is a tool to crack typical malware obfuscation such as XOR, ROL, ADD (and many combinations), by bruteforcing all possible keys and and checking for specific patterns (IP addresses, domain names, URLs, known file headers and strings, etc) using the Balbuzard engine. The main difference with similar tools is that it supports a large number of transforms, extensible with python scripts, and it uses a specific algorithm based on patterns of interest.</p>
<h3 id="features-1">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>provided with a large number of obfuscation transforms such as XOR, ROL, ADD (including combined transforms)</li>
<li>supports fast character-based transforms, or any file transform</li>

<li>transforms easily extensible by python scripts</li>
<li>options to select which transforms to check</li>
<li>can open malware in password-protected zip files without writing to disk</li>
<li>pure python 2.x, no dependency or compilation</li>
</ul>

<li>optional use of the Yara engine and Yara rules as patterns</li>
<li>CSV and HTML outputs</li>
<li>batch analysis of multiple files/folders</li>
<li>Python 3.x support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work?</h3>
<p>bbcrack contains a number of <strong>obfuscation transforms</strong> that can be applied to data. Each transform may have one or several parameters. For example, the XOR transform has a parameter (key) that can vary from 0 to 255. Each byte (B) in data is transformed to B XOR key.</p>
<p>The current version of bbcrack includes the following transforms among others: XOR, ADD, ROL, XOR+ROL, XOR+ADD, ADD+XOR, XOR with incrementing key, XOR chained, etc. Run &quot;bbcrack.py -t list&quot; to check the full list.</p>
<p>The goal is to find which transform and which parameters were used to obfuscate the data, if any. When the right transform is found, specific patterns should normally appear in cleartext.</p>
<p>For performance reasons, bbcrack uses a two-stages algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 1</strong>: all selected transforms are applied to data, with all possible parameters. For each transform, a score is computed by looking for simple strings that appear in many malicious files such as null bytes, whitespaces, end of lines, and &quot;This program cannot be run in DOS mode&quot;. The score is based on the length of the matched string and a weight for each pattern. Only the best scores are kept for stage 2.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2</strong>: for all selected transforms, a new score is computed by looking for more elaborate patterns using the Balbuzard engine, such as IP addresses, e-mail addresses, executable filenames, CamelCase words, etc. At the end, the best scores are saved to disk for further investigation. If the file was effectively obfuscated using one of those transforms, the content should now appear in cleartext.</li>

<h3 id="how-to-select-transforms">How to select transforms</h3>
<p>Transforms are organized in three levels (1,2,3): Level 1 are the simplest/fastest transforms (such as XOR), level 2 are more complex transforms (such as XOR+ADD), and level 3 are less frequent or slower transforms. See below for the full list.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>identity: Identity Transformation, no change to data. Parameters: none.</li>
<li>xor: XOR with 8 bits static key A. Parameters: A (1-FF).</li>
<li>add: ADD with 8 bits static key A. Parameters: A (1-FF).</li>
<li>rol: ROL - rotate A bits left. Parameters: A (1-7).</li>
<li>xor_rol: XOR with static 8 bits key A, then rotate B bits left. Parameters: A (1-FF), B (1-7).</li>
<li>add_rol: ADD with static 8 bits key A, then rotate B bits left. Parameters: A (1-FF), B (1-7).</li>
<li>rol_add: rotate A bits left, then ADD with static 8 bits key B. Parameters: A (1-7), B (1-FF).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>xor_add: XOR with 8 bits static key A, then ADD with 8 bits static key B. Parameters: A (1-FF), B (1-FF).</li>
<li>add_xor: ADD with 8 bits static key A, then XOR with 8 bits static key B. Parameters: A (1-FF), B (1-FF).</li>
<li>xor_inc: XOR with 8 bits key A incrementing after each character. Parameters: A (0-FF).</li>
<li>xor_dec: XOR with 8 bits key A decrementing after each character. Parameters: A (0-FF).</li>
<li>sub_inc: SUB with 8 bits key A incrementing after each character. Parameters: A (0-FF).</li>
<li>xor_chained: XOR with 8 bits key A chained with previous character. Parameters: A (1-FF).</li>
<li>xor_rchained: XOR with 8 bits key A chained with next character (Reverse order from end to start). Parameters: A (1-FF).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Level 3:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>xor_inc_rol: XOR with 8 bits key A incrementing after each character, then rotate B bits left. Parameters: A (0-FF), B (1-7).</li>
<li>xor_rchained_all: XOR Transform, chained from the right with all following cha racters. Only works well with bbharvest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Options -l and -i</strong>:</p>
<p>With the option -l, all the transforms up to the specified level are selected. The following command will check transforms of all levels 1, 2 and 3 at once:</p>
<pre><code>bbcrack.py -l 3 sample.exe</code></pre>
<p>With the option -i, only the specified level is selected. This is useful if you try first level 1 for a quick check, then levels 2 or 3 without running level 1 again.</p>
<pre><code>bbcrack.py -i 1 sample.exe
bbcrack.py -i 2 sample.exe</code></pre>
<h3 id="a-real-life-example">A real-life example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="http://contagiodump.blogspot.nl/2010/02/feb-2-cve-2009-4324-rep-mike-castle.html">this sample</a> from Contagio (ask me or Mila for the zip password if you don't know the contagio scheme).</li>
<li>The sample PDF contains in fact two PDFs (starting with &quot;%PDF&quot;, ending with &quot;%EOF&quot;) and a binary blob in between, which looks obfuscated.</li>
<li>In you favorite hex editor (e.g. FileInsight, PSPad, UltraEdit, etc), extract the binary blob from offset 1000h to ACC7h (40136 bytes long) to a file named payload.bin.</li>
<li><p>Then run:</p>
<pre><code>bbcrack.py -l 3 payload.bin </code></pre></li>
<li><p>it may take an hour to run. Or if you are in a hurry, you can cheat with:</p>
<pre><code>bbcrack.py -t xor_inc_rol payload.bin</code></pre></li>
<li>In the end, the best score is for the transform xor00_inc_rol5 (XOR with incremental key starting at 0, then ROL 5 bits).</li>
<li><p>open the file payload_xor00_inc_rol5.bin in a hex viewer: it should be a malicious executable file in cleartext.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>if you only have a couple minutes, run a quick bbcrack at level 1.</li>
<li>if you have 5-10 minutes, run bbcrack at level 2, go for a coffee.</li>
<li>if nothing found, run bbcrack at level 3 while you go for lunch or during the night.</li>
<li>if you found nothing, run bbharvest at level 1 or 2, just to check if there are multiple transforms.</li>
<li>if you found an executable file, run bbharvest on the decoded file. Some executables have strings hidden by multiple transforms, so they would be missed by bbcrack in normal mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-extend-the-list-of-patterns-and-transforms">How to extend the list of patterns and transforms</h3>
<p>It is possible to extend bbcrack with your own transforms, using simple Python scripts. For this, you need to write a class, inheriting either from Transform_char or Transform_string:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform_char: for transforms that apply to each character/byte independently, not depending on the location of the character. (example: simple XOR)</li>
<li>Transform_string: for all other transforms, that may apply to several characters at once, or taking into account the location of the character. (example: XOR with increasing key)</li>
</ul>
<p>Transform plugin scripts must be stored in the plugins subfolder, with a name starting with &quot;trans_&quot;. Read the contents of the provided script &quot;trans_sample_plugin.py&quot; for detailed explanations and sample transforms that you can reuse.</p>
<p>All transforms and plugins are shared by bbcrack, bbharvest and bbtrans.</p>
<p>If you develop useful plugin scripts and you would like me to reference them, or if you think about additional transforms that bbcrack should include, please <a href="http://www.decalage.info/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
<p>Coming soon: it will be possible to add new patterns for bbcrack using plugin scripts in python, similarly to balbuzard.</p>

<h2 id="bbharvest">bbharvest:</h2>
<p>bbharvest extracts all patterns of interest found when applying transforms such as XOR, ROL, ADD and various combinations, trying all possible keys. It is especially useful when several keys or several transforms are used in a single file.</p>
<h3 id="features-2">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>uses the balbuzard engine and patterns, and bbcrack transforms</li>
<li>search for string or regular expression patterns</li>
<li>default set of patterns for malware analysis: IP addresses, e-mail addresses, URLs, typical EXE strings, common file headers, various malware strings</li>
<li>provided with a large number of obfuscation transforms such as XOR, ROL, ADD (including combined transforms)</li>
<li>supports fast character-based transforms, or any file transform</li>
<li>transforms easily extensible by python scripts</li>
<li>effective on malware with multiple obfuscations/keys</li>
<li>options to select which transforms to check</li>
<li>CSV output</li>
<li>can open malware in password-protected zip files without writing to disk</li>
<li>pure python 2.x, no dependency or compilation</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>patterns and transforms easily extensible by python scripts</li>
<li>optional use of the Yara engine and Yara rules as patterns</li>
<li>CSV and HTML outputs</li>
<li>batch analysis of multiple files/folders</li>
<li>Python 3.x support</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-2">How does it work?</h3>
<p>While bbcrack is great for malware obfuscated with a single transform and a single key, it might not be effective on malware using several transforms and/or several keys to obfuscate different parts or strings in a single file. For example a malware may use a different XOR key for each string. bbcrack may also fail if only specific strings are obfuscated, such as IP addresses.</p>
<p>bbharvest is designed to address these cases, by trying all transforms and all keys, extracting specific patterns of interest that can be found. This way, even if a URL or an IP address is obfuscated with a transform and key used only once, it should be reported by bbharvest.</p>
<p>However, bbharvest may return a lot of false positives. It is therefore necessary to analyze the results manually in order to extract meaningful data.</p>
<p>By default the search is limited to level 1 transforms, for time reasons. You may increase the scope using the options -l or -i.</p>
