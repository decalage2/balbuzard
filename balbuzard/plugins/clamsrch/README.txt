The Yara signatures in this folder were obtained by converting clamsrch 
signatures available here:

http://code.google.com/p/clamsrch/

The original signatures were published with the signsrch tool here:

http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#signsrch

The clamsrch signatures were converted from ClamAV to Yara format using the 
tool clamav_to_yara.py from the Malware Analyst's Cookbook:
